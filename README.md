Fervosity
=========

iPhone Prayer App

Application would enable the user to input text or voice as a prayer request, along with selecting from a pre-defined list of deities or other entities (or input their own). User may also enter any offering or sacrifice which will be given in exchange for the granting of this request.

Supplicant would then be required to kneel, etc and hold out their cell phone with both hands in front of them to the sky in a suitable gesture of prayer. [Perhaps "reception" at that moment could be displayed in typical bar form]

Application could take a photo of the supplicant's face to measure their "fervosity," as well as select for other possible determining factors as to the probable efficacy of their praying savvy. 

User would be able to select "I need a miracle" setting, kind of like the Google "I'm feeling lucky" button.

Phone would periodically remind them to renew their prayer request, if it has not been fulfilled. If it has been, user would be required to deliver on original terms set forth in prayer (offering, etc) or make a public announcement (via website) kind of like people sometimes do to saints in the newspaper. 

Program could also return "tentative results" in the form of tarot card, i ching, randomly selected google image...

Also thought that during the "prayer moment" the screen could formulate random sort of pareidolic imagery which you could use to sort of divine shapes out of like an inkblot, and which would allow your mind to wander a little into the intuitive state
